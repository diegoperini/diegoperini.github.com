Since this also stands to be the very first post of this blog, I wanted it to be about me instead of some random revolutionary idea about programming that is rather difficult to implement but extremely useful in cases where my ego has the top priority over other solutions.

Dear readers (and future me),

Please be aware that whatever written in this post (including the upcoming ones) must be taken with a grain of salt. Ideas are almost always subjective in nature before they are proven true by science. I do not intend to provide proofs of any kind, nor do I require them to express my feelings and opinions. I tend to prove myself wrong in yearly intervals which points to progress I guess. I trust and thank to your skepticism. This blog will kind of depend on that.

Let's set our clocks back a few years in order to clearly inspect the beginning of this "I'd Rather Do It For Myself" principle.

I don't think I like competitions when they don't test both skills and hard work at the same time. Skills are hard to discover. You can't basically know that you are good at something before trying to do it for the first time. The fundamental approach of this discovery process comes with the fact that required amount of these trials may often be quite large. Boredom is a powerful obstacle, even if you manage to find the thing you are looking for. It is not possible to make a profession out of a skill before working hard on it. This is a spoiler I luckily managed to deduce by simply, reading news. Exceptional people don't become news before making something ground breaking. The more readings/watchings I do, the more I find out that each one of these people initially spent their time with activities that are extremely boring. 

Cool! Let's put that into the "TODO LIST of my life" as first entry.

**"Spot the least boring skill of yours and learn not to get bored when you work on it."**

*To be continued...*
